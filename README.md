ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan McLatcher!

I'm currently a 2nd Year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech.


Here are some of my personal projects I've worked on:
* [File Explorer Helper for Windows](https://github.com/jdmclatcher/file-explorer-helper)

* [Laser Drop (Android Game on Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EmpoweredPixel.LaserDrop)

I've got 2 summers of work experience at Axis Group writing code in React (2018 & 2019).

I was also contracted by UKG to write Python [code](https://github.com/jdmclatcher/excel-data-transforms) to automate data transformations and provide insights for sales data (2021).

Check out my [website](https://jdmclatcher.com) for more information about me!
