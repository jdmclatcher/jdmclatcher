ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan McLatcher!

I'm currently a 3rd Year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech.


Here are some of my personal projects I've worked on:
* [Full-Stack Banking Management System](https://github.com/jdmclatcher/bank-management-portal)

* [File Explorer Helper for Windows](https://github.com/jdmclatcher/file-explorer-helper)

* [Laser Drop (Android Game on Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EmpoweredPixel.LaserDrop)

I was a summer intern at Amazon in the Alexa AI organization working on Natural Language Understanding tools for Alexa Skill Development (2022).

I was contracted by UKG to write Python [code](https://github.com/jdmclatcher/excel-data-transforms) to automate data transformations and provide insights for sales & subscription data (2021).

I also have 2 summers of work experience at Axis Group writing code in React (2018 & 2019).
